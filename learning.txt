Some things I've learnt about git encompass the following:
1. Git helps keep track of changes in your code so you can always go back to previous versions if needed.
 2. You can use commands like git add, git commit, and git push to save and upload your work to GitHub.
 3. Git makes it easy to collaborate with others on the same project without messing up each otherâ€™s code.
